# PetPal

## Introduction
PetPal is a web application that mediates connections between pet owners and caregivers in major Vietnamese cities. It enables users to contact each other, arrange meet-ups, and exchange pet care services. Safety is ensured through a thorough screening process, and the platform includes features for user registration, detailed pet profiles, and search/filter functionality.

### User Story
**Example:**
Emily is a pet owner with two cats, Meo and Miu. She is planning a weekend getaway and needs someone to feed and play with her cats. Emily logs into the PetPal platform and filters her search for caregivers who are willing to care for cats and are located within a 3km radius of her apartment.

The platform displays a map with nearby caregivers, and Emily can view their profiles and read reviews from other cat owners. She notices that one caregiver, Jessica, has a love for cats and has received excellent reviews for her attentive care. Emily initiates a chat with Jessica through the platform and explains her needs. They agree on a schedule, and Emily drops off her cats at Jessicaâ€™s place. Emily feels at ease knowing her cats are in good hands while she is away.
